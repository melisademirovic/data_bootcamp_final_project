### Project Description

This project studies the fluctuation of income inequality over time within the United States by using data from the US Cluster Mapping Website run by the US Economic Development Administration and Harvard Business School. The data on income is available within the time frame between 1998 and 2016 inclusive, and both, in an aggregate form for the US, and in a detailed form across Economic Areas (i.e. states) and Economics Clusters (i.e. sectors or industries) inside the US. The project portrays a tentative conclusion that fluctuations of  specific Economic Clusters drive the changes in income inequality in states that deviate from the general US trend.
